	  http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2008-2.html
	* Fixed bug preventing device dialog being reopened when
	  closed via the window manager.

All users with speex handling enabled should upgrade.

New in this release:

	* ALSA is now the default driver. see README.OSS for oss
	* minimum supported gtk version raised to 2.4

	* remove direct flac support as it's supported by libsndfile now
	  (Erik de Castro Lopo)
	* added a new splash screen (Pascal Klein)

	* other bugs addressed and changes made. run "svn log" on a copy of svn
	  trunk for details, or check http://trac.metadecks.org/timeline
	* released 0.9.2


Mon Jan 30 2006 -- Version 0.9.1
--------------------------------

This is a maintenance release.

The previous release (0.9.0) had a bug that prevented sweep from
populating the ALSA devices in settings. The bug was only apparent
when you built with ALSA and didn't have a previous installation
of sweep that used ALSA.

If you installed sweep 0.9.0 and had problems getting any sound
output then please upgrade to 0.9.1.

Mon Aug 22 2005 -- Version 0.8.4
--------------------------------

This is maintenance release, including:

 	* updates for ALSA 1.0 (Daniel Dreschers, Charles Turner),
	* a new Polish translation (Radoslaw Korzeniewski),
        * an updated russian translation (Alex Prokoudine),
	* a small fix to the German translation, and
	* various minor tweaks and improvements.

This is likely to be the last Sweep release based on GTK+-1.2. Further
development will use GTK+-2.0 for the interface.

Over the last year, Peter Shorthose has developed a comprehensive set of
GTK+-2.0 patches for Sweep, and will handle their merging and ongoing
release management towards Sweep 1.0. Welcome Peter!

The trunk of sweep CVS has been migrated to a new Subversion repository.        
You can check it out by:                                                        

  svn co http://svn.metadecks.org/sweep/trunk sweep                             

svn.metadecks.org can also be browsed via trac at:                              

  http://trac.metadecks.org/                                                    


Fri Apr 30 2004 -- Version 0.8.3
--------------------------------

This is a maintenance release, including a new Spanish translation,
various bugfixes and no new functionality.

Sweep has moved back into CVS at SourceForge. Five new developers have
been added to the project: Yuri Bongiorno, Erik de Castro Lopo, Torben 
Hohn, Andr? Pang, and Alexandre Prokoudine.

Internationalization (i18n) improvements:
                                                                               
	* a new Spanish translation by Juan Manuel Martinez
        * an updated Italian translation by Yuri Bongiorno

Bugfixes:

	* resampler bug fixed by Erik de Castro Lopo 
	* made main scrollbar arrows useful (bug #821596)
	* seven other bug reports closed
	* compile warning fixes for GCC3

The dependency on libtdb has been removed. TDB sources are now pulled
directly from the upstream Samba subversion repository.


Wed Apr 30 2003 -- Version 0.8.2
--------------------------------

This release contains support for ALSA 0.9; this is configurable and could
do with widespread testing.
                                                                                
To build with ALSA support, simply configure with:
                                                                                
        ./configure --enable-alsa
                                                                                
Note that this will build a binary which will work with ALSA only, and
not attempt to use OSS. In future this will be replaced with plugins
for different pcm i/o methods, which should ease binary distribution.


Internationalization (i18n) improvements:

	* a complete audit of untranslatable strings, including
	mis-configured source files and unmarked strings, by
	Silvia Pfeiffer.

	* a new Greek translation by Dokianakis Fanis
	* a new Russian translation by Alexandre Prokoudine
	* an updated Italian translation by Yuri Bongiorno
	* an updated German translation by Silvia Pfeiffer

There is a new mailing list: sweep-i18n. List information is at
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/sweep-i18n

	* added VBR without DTX option for Speex 1.0 speech encoding
	* improved accuracy of sliders in processing dialogs

Fri Dec  6 2002 -- Version 0.5.12
---------------------------------

New in this release:

	* an updated Italian translation from Yuri Bongiorno

	* resample (sample rate conversion): change the sample rate of a
	file, for example from CD format to DAT format, or to any arbitrary
	sample rate. This requires Erik de Castro Lopo's newly released
	libsamplerate, available from http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/

	* preview cut: hear how the area around the selection will sound
	after the selection is cut out, including the parts between
	selection regions for multi-region selections.

	* preroll to cursor: play one second of sound leading up to the
	cursor; useful for hearing the cursor position without moving it.

Bugs were fixed in MP3 loading and pitched playback (using QWERTY keys).


Thu Nov 28 2002 -- Version 0.5.11
---------------------------------

New features in this release include:

	* mixing and crossfading paste methods: copy a region from one file
	and mix or fade it into another file or elsewhere in the same file,
	with control of source and destination levels and phase.

	* navigation shortcuts to move between selection edges: move the
	cursor between the start and end of selection regions, and to the
	next edge of a multi-region selection, with Ctrl + Arrow Left/Right

	* view memories: assign the viewable area to a number on the numeric
	keypad with Ctrl+<Num>, and zoom back to it later by pressing that
	number. (NB. Num Lock must be on on your keyboard).

	* support for Speex 1.0beta3 ultra-wideband mode (32kHz). Speex is
	a high quality, patent-free and open source voice codec.
