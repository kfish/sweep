Fri Apr 30 2004 -- Sweep 0.8.3 Released

Sweep is an audio editor and live playback tool for GNU/Linux, BSD and
compatible systems. It supports many music and voice formats including
WAV, AIFF, Ogg Vorbis, Speex and MP3, with multichannel editing and
LADSPA effects plugins. Inside lives a pesky little virtual stylus 
called
Scrubby who enjoys mixing around in your files.
