Mon Aug 22 2005 -- Sweep 0.8.4 Released
=======================================

Sweep is an audio editor and live playback tool for GNU/Linux, BSD and
compatible systems. It supports many music and voice formats including
WAV, AIFF, Ogg Vorbis, Speex and MP3, with multichannel editing and
LADSPA effects plugins. Inside lives a pesky little virtual stylus called
Scrubby who enjoys mixing around in your files.

This release is available as a source tarball at:

New in this release
-------------------

This is maintenance release, including:

 	* updates for ALSA 1.0 (Daniel Dreschers, Charles Turner),
	* a new Polish translation (Radoslaw Korzeniewski),
        * an updated russian translation (Alex Prokoudine),
	* a small fix to the German translation, and
	* various minor tweaks and improvements.

Release plans
-------------

This is likely to be the last Sweep release based on GTK+-1.2. Further
development will use GTK+-2.0 for the interface.

Over the last year, Peter Shorthose has developed a comprehensive set of
GTK+-2.0 patches for Sweep, and will handle their merging and ongoing
release management towards Sweep 1.0. Welcome Peter!
