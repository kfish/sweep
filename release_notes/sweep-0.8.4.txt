<DATE> -- Sweep 0.8.4 Released
=======================================

Sweep is an audio editor and live playback tool for GNU/Linux, BSD and
compatible systems. It supports many music and voice formats including
WAV, AIFF, Ogg Vorbis, Speex and MP3, with multichannel editing and
LADSPA effects plugins. Inside lives a pesky little virtual stylus called
Scrubby who enjoys mixing around in your files.

This release is available as a source tarball at:

Latest News
-----------

This is maintainance release, including a new Polish translation,
various bugfixes and no new functionality. This is also likely to be the
last sweep release based on gtk-1.2. Further development will utilize
gtk-2.0 for the interface.

Sweep is on the move again. To leverage the increased flexibility provided
by Subversion, and to allow for more control over the environment,
Sweep development has relocated from sourceforge CVS to a SVN
server, reachable at: http://svn.metadecks.org via the WebDAV protocol. 

In addition, I've has setup a trac environment at http://trac.metadecks.org 

Those of you who are not familiar with SVN or Trac can find more
information at the following sites:

  Trac home page:	http://www.edgewall.com/trac/  
  SVN homepage:		http://subversion.tigris.org/

But broadly speaking, SVN is equivilent to CVS, albeit with added 
and improved functionality, and Trac provides the following features:
  
  a wiki
  a bug/issue tracker
  a web interface for viewing the SVN repository

and numerous other useful things in a neatly intergrated package.
