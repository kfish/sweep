Wed Jan 18 2006 -- Sweep 0.9.0 Released
=======================================

Sweep is an audio editor and live playback tool for GNU/Linux, BSD and
compatible systems. It supports many music and voice formats including
WAV, AIFF, Ogg Vorbis, Speex and MP3, with multichannel editing and
LADSPA effects plugins. Inside lives a pesky little virtual stylus called
Scrubby who enjoys mixing around in your files.

This release is available as a source tarball at:

New in this release
-------------------

This release is the first in a new unstable series.

Changes include:

  * sweep now uses gtk2 for it's interface
  * improved mp3 detection and loading
  * a new SVG icon for sweep (Alex Kloss)
  * corrected a note to key mapping for pc keyboard playback (Paul Brossier)
  * an updated Spanish translation (Waldo Ramirez Montano)
  * an updated Polish translation (Radoslaw Korzeniewski)
  * more minor tweaks and improvements.

Release plans
-------------

  This first release based on gtk2 begins what we hope will be a short 
  lived unstable series, leading up to the stable 1.0 release.
	
  The priority will be ensuring that the gtk2 port really is complete 
  and bug free, but it's likely that a few important or useful new 
  features will be squeezed in. 
  
  Hopefully including:
			
		* jack support 
		* simple file loading via drag and drop
		* some form of LADSPA plugin browser (with bookmarks, search etc)
 		* modular drivers (no more hardcoded default) 
			
  When 1.0 is released, work will begin on what will become sweep 2.0.
  this will be based around Conrad's libremix library and will enable sweep
  to perform on disk editing (removing the need to load entire files into
  memory), non destructive editing and much more besides. 

			

Development news
----------------

The only significant change over 0.8.4 comes from the use of gtk2
for the interface. as such, you will now need gtk-2.0 (version 2.2.0 or greater)
and it's dependencies to use sweep and the associated development packages
to build sweep 0.9.0 from source.

gtk-2.0 can be found here: 
	
	http://www.gtk.org/ 
	
Or via your distribution's package system. (apt, rpm etc)
