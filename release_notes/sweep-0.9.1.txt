Mon Jan 30 2006 -- Sweep 0.9.1 Released
=======================================

Sweep is an audio editor and live playback tool for GNU/Linux, BSD and
compatible systems. It supports many music and voice formats including
WAV, AIFF, Ogg Vorbis, Speex and MP3, with multichannel editing and
LADSPA effects plugins. Inside lives a pesky little virtual stylus called
Scrubby who enjoys mixing around in your files.

This release is available as a source tarball at:

    http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sweep/sweep-0.9.1.tar.bz2?download


New in this release
-------------------

This is a maintenance release.

The previous release (0.9.0) had a bug that prevented sweep from
populating the ALSA devices in settings. The bug was only apparent
when you built with ALSA and didn't have a previous installation
of sweep that used ALSA.

If you installed sweep 0.9.0 and had problems getting any sound
output then please upgrade to 0.9.1.

	* looped, reverse, and pitch-controlled playback
	* playback mixing of unlimited independent tracks
	* looped and reverse recording
	* internationalisation
	* multichannel and 32 bit floating point PCM file support
