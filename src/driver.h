 * what the offset of the sound that's currently coming out of the speaker is
 * and draws it there (which may be a little behind or ahead of where the
 * user is scrubbing) -- hence the sound and the vision are kept in sync.
 *

 * properly monitoring the latency of multiple files being played
 * simultaneously; plus it may have to change with respect to ALSA and JACK and
 * PortAudio. So for now, just return -1.
